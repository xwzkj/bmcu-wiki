# What is BMCU

**BMCU** is the next-generation project following **AMCU**. It is a third-party open-source automatic material switching system compatible with **AMS lite**. BMCU is compact, low-cost, and fully open-source. üõ†Ô∏è

Its stability is not as high as AMS lite, and as a third-party accessory, it may become unusable due to future official firmware updates. ‚ö†Ô∏è

::: info The following description comes from the BMCU project on [Lichuang Open Source Hardware Platform (OSHWHub)](https://oshwhub.com/bamboo-shoot-xmcu-pcb-team/bmcu)

**BMCU** is designed based on open-source materials. Referring to the protocol information of **bambubus** on GitHub and community-provided reference data, we created a system that simulates the behavior of AMS, applicable to the A-series printers. BMCU is a specialized evolution of AMCU, and many of its design concepts are based on publicly available information about the working principles of **AMS lite**.

Due to its reliance on open-source content and its high functional similarity to AMS lite, **BMCU is open-source but not allowed for commercial use**. It is strictly for personal DIY and educational purposes.
