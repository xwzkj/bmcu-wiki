## Firmware Collection

Below includes recommended firmware versions for different models and naming conventions

### Naming Convention

1. 130 firmware: v0.2
2. Early firmware: Uses date format, e.g. `Firmware 3-14` means released on March 14, 2025
3. Naming rule modified in May 2025: BMCU version + major version + test sequence number (optional). Stable versions omit the sequence number. Example: `BMCU-C-V0.1-0013 Test` means for BMCU-C, V0.1 version, 13th test version.
Note: When major version changes, the test sequence number continues incrementing without reset.

### Firmware for 130 Version

Recommended to use v0.2 stable version. Due to its early stage, our collection is incomplete and only v0.2 (stable) is recommended.

### Firmware for BMCU-B (Steel Ball)/Early 370 Version

Popular version is `3-14`. This version improves performance and reduces (but doesn't completely eliminate) the "five-way burst" issue. If the five-way is already weakened, bursting may still occur.

### Firmware for BMCU-C (Hall Effect)

BMCU-C is under active development. This content was written on May 26, 2025 - please check timeliness.

As of now, the latest test firmware is `BMCU-C-V0.1-0013 Test`, which has been tested working well on A1.

Other popular versions:

- `4-23-2` recommended for A1
- `4-23-3` recommended for P/X series

The difference is that -3 version has more aggressive feeding and may cause noticeable impact noise on A1.
