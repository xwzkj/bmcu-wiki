**Preface**

BMCU is primarily open-sourced by 4061N, with Parentheses contributing to the BMCU component framework and the design of the BMCU-to-printer bracket.

BMCU is designed with four channels as one unit, currently using the CH32 microcontroller as the main control. All required design references are based on publicly available online materials and personal testing. The program is developed on the Platform IO platform using the Arduino support library for CH32 microcontrollers and incorporates the CRC library by robtillaart. Note: This project follows the GPL2.0 open-source license, with the additional stipulation that it is prohibited for commercial use.

BMCU is intended for DIY learning and must be used with Bambu Lab printers A1 or A1mini to achieve functionality similar to AMS lite, enabling multi-color and multi-filament printing with automatic filament switching and feeding. However, it lacks the RFID automatic filament recognition feature. We still recommend purchasing the official Bambu Lab AMS lite for better reliability. Please note that DIY projects come with inherent risks, and the author is not responsible for any resulting issues.

**This project requires basic soldering skills. Beginners should seek separate soldering tutorials, as this guide does not cover basic soldering techniques.**

## Firmware Flashing

**IMPORTANT!!! Before flashing the firmware, ensure there are no solder bridges, shorts, cold joints, or incorrect component orientations on the PCB. Otherwise, the board may be damaged.**

**Testing method:**
- Use a multimeter in continuity mode to check for shorts between the positive and negative terminals of the voltage regulator (no beep means normal).
- Check capacitors for continuity (normally no beep).
- Check for shorts between the 3.3V and GND pins (no continuous beep).
- Use the multimeter in resistance mode to verify resistor values are within the correct range.

1. Recommended USB-to-TTL module (fewer issues):

2. Follow the firmware flashing tutorial and **precautions**.

**Note: For the USB-C version, failing to remove protection on the first flash attempt is normal. Just proceed with the download. For subsequent flashes, remove protection twice until successful before downloading.**

## BMCU Assembly

### Step 1: Pre-Assembly PCB Testing

1. Ensure the BMCU mainboard firmware (V0.2) is successfully flashed (red LED lights up when powered via USB-to-TTL; blue LED lights up when connected to the printer via MX3.0 4-pin cable).
2. Ensure the sub-board functions correctly:
   - **When powered via USB**: The RGB LED should be blue (port 1 blue, ports 2-4 off; blinking is normal). The two photoelectric sensor LEDs should be off. When the sensor is blocked, the corresponding backlight should turn on. The feed RGB LED turns blue; the jam RGB LED turns red.
   - **When powered by the Bambu Lab printer**: Both the mainboard and sub-board RGB LEDs should be blue. The photoelectric sensor LEDs should be off. When blocked, the backlight turns on, and the RGB LED remains blue.
3. Ensure proper communication between the mainboard, sub-board, and printer. When connected, the printer's filament menu should show the AMS option, and blocking the sensor should display the filament.

### Step 2: Mechanical Assembly Part 1 (Feeder Unit, 4 Units Required for 1 Set)

1. **First, print one feeder shell and test for fit before printing the rest to avoid material waste.** This tutorial uses this model: https://makerworld.com.cn/models/741793 (modified by 青铜板子cn).
2. Screw the pneumatic fitting (**PC4-M6 passthrough**) into the buffer assembly. **Avoid misalignment**.

## Mounting Bracket Options

No fixed tutorial. Many Bambu Lab-compatible bracket models are available online. Choose one that suits your needs.

## Troubleshooting

::: details Printer does not recognize BMCU (AMS not displayed), mainboard shows red LED
**Solution:** Usually caused by reversed A/B wires in the cable. Swap them. If unresolved, check for soldering issues (cold joints, bridges) or faulty communication components (e.g., incorrectly oriented or poorly soldered chips). If using a DC-DC module, voltage instability may be the cause.
:::

::: details Filament detected when none is present, or sensor LED flickers
**Solution:** Often due to misaligned sensor holes in the original shell model, loose feed channels, or poorly soldered sensors. Use the improved shell with replaceable sensor modules or resolder the sensor.
:::

::: details Filament feeds then retracts, failing to load
**Solution:** Common causes: missing radial magnet, magnet stuck, missing extruder gear set screw, incorrect magnet type/size (must be 6×2.5mm radial magnet). Test by rotating two magnets 180°—they should repel. Alternatively, check for AS5600 encoder soldering errors or gear jams causing step loss.

:::

::: details Flashing fails—device not recognized (no COM port)
**Solution:** Usually due to a short (3.3V to GND), incorrect wiring, or driver issues (rare—most USB-TTL adapters auto-install drivers).
:::

::: details Flashing fails—protection removal or download fails, or software does not detect COM port
**Solution:** Often caused by incorrectly oriented or poorly soldered MCU, wrong wiring, or incompatible flasher (older models may not work with newer Windows versions). For USB-C boards, retry protection removal twice.
:::

::: details Feeder motor spins but does not feed/retract, or gears do not turn when they should
**Solution:** Usually due to loose/faulty triangular clutch gears or shell misalignment causing gear binding.

**wanzi's note:**
See [Troubleshooting](/doc/debug/problems) for solutions.
:::

::: details Loud feeder noise
**Solution:** Often caused by misaligned worm gear (not flush with motor shaft), gear friction, or lack of lubrication (apply grease).
:::

::: details Filament inserted, sub-board LED on, but printer does not detect it
**Solution:** Often due to missing magnet (requires power cycle—**avoid hot-plugging**). Press the mainboard R button or check for loose PH2.0 connectors/cable breaks. Resolder if needed.
:::

::: details Sub-board LEDs malfunction without shell; or constant red LED when no filament is inserted
**Solution:** Often due to reversed resistors, incorrect PH2.0 **male-to-male reverse** 10-pin cables (80mm), loose connectors, or solder bridges (common near resistors/capacitors).
:::

::: details Filament inserted, sub-board LED off, but printer displays it
**Solution:** Usually caused by reversed LED polarity. Correct as shown:

:::

::: details Print stalls at 99%, endless retraction, or fails to auto-unload
**Solution:** Cause unclear (may be communication or hardware related). Manually unload the filament. Properly adjusting the triangular clutch gears and placing the BMCU sideways can reduce occurrences.
