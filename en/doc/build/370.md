# BMCU-B (370 Steel Ball Version) Assembly Guide

## This version and its derivatives are outdated and no longer maintained by the Bambu Lab team

## Preface

This article is entirely written by wanzi.

This is an assembly guide for the 370 steel ball version compatible with firmware version 3-14, and it is also somewhat applicable to other steel ball versions.

If you don't have the parts yet, please purchase them from the [Parts List](/doc/prepare/list).

I made this guide when I was passionate about it. If it helps you, feel free to support me at [Support Wiki Operation](../other/donate.md)~ 😊

## Preparation before Assembly

You need a fully soldered BMCU circuit board, ensuring no soldering defects (such as cold solder joints, missing joints, solder bridges, wrong soldering, etc.), then flash the firmware onto it. The firmware flashing tutorial can be found in the group files for now.

You need to flash firmware version 3-14, which is compatible with both A-series and P-series.

### Assemble the 182A Gear and 2*20 Shaft

Press the shaft into the gear as shown, making sure both ends protrude roughly equally.

![Install Shaft into 182A Gear](/assets/build/build-370/components/给182a齿轮装轴.jpg)

### Install the Worm Gear on the 370 Motor

For motors purchased from "Jiali Motor," press the worm gear all the way down; the length fits perfectly.

![Install Worm Gear on Motor](/assets/build/build-370/components/给电机装蜗杆.jpg)

### Assemble the Buffer

Assemble the `slider post` and `slider` together.

![Assemble Buffer-1](/assets/build/build-370/components/组装缓冲-1.jpg)  
![Assemble Buffer-2](/assets/build/build-370/components/组装缓冲-2.jpg)

Put a `0.6*12x30mm spring` on the assembled buffer and place it into the `back cover`.

![Assemble Buffer-3](/assets/build/build-370/components/组装缓冲-3.jpg)

Let the spring clip onto the edge of the back cover.

![Assemble Buffer-4](/assets/build/build-370/components/组装缓冲-4.jpg)

### Install Motor and Gear

Place the previously assembled gear and motor into the back cover.

![Place Motor and Gear into Back Cover](/assets/build/build-370/components/把电机和齿轮放入后盖.jpg)

Use a screwdriver through the hole at the bottom to fix the 370 motor with an `m3*5` flat-head screw.

![Fix 370 Motor](/assets/build/build-370/components/固定370电机.jpg)

### Install Material Break Detection Part

Put the `steel ball` into the `back cover` as shown.

![Insert Steel Ball into Back Cover](/assets/build/build-370/components/把钢珠放入后盖.jpg)

Then insert the `steel ball slider` into the `back cover`.

![Insert Steel Ball Slider into Back Cover](/assets/build/build-370/components/把钢珠滑块放入后盖.jpg)

### Install Hex Nut

In version 3-14, the self-tapping screw hole here was changed to a nut for machine screws to avoid thread stripping caused by frequent assembly/disassembly of the `feeding component` and `base`.

Place the `hex nut` into the `back cover`.

![Insert Hex Nut into Back Cover](/assets/build/build-370/components/把六角螺母放入后盖.jpg)

Insert the `nut plug` to fix the `hex nut`.

![Insert Nut Plug](/assets/build/build-370/components/放入螺母塞.jpg)  
![Secure Nut Plug in Place](/assets/build/build-370/components/把螺母塞安装到位.jpg)

### Install BMG Drive Wheel

The image below shows all parts of the BMG gear set.

![BMG Gear Set](/assets/build/build-370/components/BMG齿轮套装.jpg)

Take one `D5x22mm shaft` and two `MR85ZZ bearings`, press the shaft into one bearing so the bottom surface is flush.

::: danger Note  
Apply even force during installation, keep it level and vertical to avoid bearing jamming or incorrect installation. Also, the shaft is said to have poor precision; please evaluate before use.  
:::

![Assemble BMG Drive Wheel - Bottom Bearing Installed](/assets/build/build-370/components/组装bmg主动轮-2-底部轴承安装到位.jpg)

Insert the `bmg extruder wheel` with the grub screw hole facing the direction shown.

![Assemble BMG Drive Wheel - BMG](/assets/build/build-370/components/组装bmg主动轮-3-bmg.jpg)

Use a `hex wrench` to install the grub screw into the bmg's grub screw hole.

![Assemble BMG Drive Wheel - Grub Screw](/assets/build/build-370/components/组装bmg主动轮-4-顶丝.jpg)

Install the top bearing so it fits flush with the bmg extruder wheel.

![Assemble BMG Drive Wheel - Top Bearing](/assets/build/build-370/components/组装bmg主动轮-5-顶部轴承.jpg)  
![Assemble BMG Drive Wheel - Completed](/assets/build/build-370/components/组装bmg主动轮-6-完成.jpg)

Place the assembled `bmg drive wheel` into the `back cover` with the gear facing up as shown.

![Insert BMG Drive Wheel into Back Cover](/assets/build/build-370/components/把bmg主动轮放入后盖.jpg)

### Assemble BMG Driven Wheel

Insert two `needle bearings` into the remaining bmg extruder wheel without a grub screw hole.

![Assemble BMG Driven Wheel - Insert Needle Bearings](/assets/build/build-370/components/组装bmg从动轮-1-放入滚针轴承.jpg)

Place it into the wrench, **pay attention to the installation direction**, then insert the shaft included in the `bmg gear set`.

![Assemble BMG Driven Wheel - Insert into Wrench and Shaft](/assets/build/build-370/components/组装bmg从动轮-2-放入扳手-插入轴.jpg)

### Lubricate the Gears

I use Hutou's "Car Door Hinge and Slideway Grease." You can choose other `greases`, but **do not use lubricating oil**.

![Lubricate Gears](/assets/build/build-370/components/给齿轮上润滑.jpg)

### Insert Steel Ball Spring

![Insert Steel Ball Spring](/assets/build/build-370/components/放入钢珠弹簧.jpg)

### Close the Middle Frame

![Close Middle Frame](/assets/build/build-370/components/合上中框.jpg)

Fix the middle frame with `m2*8` screws.

![Fix Middle Frame with Screws](/assets/build/build-370/components/用螺丝固定中框.jpg)

### Install the Wrench

Place the `wrench` into the assembly, insert a `0.6*4x10mm spring`.

![Install Wrench - Spring](/assets/build/build-370/components/安装扳手-1-弹簧.jpg)

::: tip  
If your tubing and filament rack have high resistance, or if you are using a P1 printer, use [this model](https://makerworld.com.cn/zh/models/1167775) to pad inside the wrench spring slot to increase grip force.  
:::

Press down on the wrench and insert a `2*20 shaft` to fix the wrench.

![Install Wrench - Shaft](/assets/build/build-370/components/安装扳手-2-轴.jpg)

### Install Pneumatic Fitting on Buffer

Screw the pneumatic fitting into the buffer.

![Install Pneumatic Fitting on Buffer](/assets/build/build-370/components/安装缓冲器气动接头.jpg)

### Insert Radial Magnet

Place the radial magnet into the magnet hole of the middle frame, with the magnet slightly below the frame.

This image is taken from the 370x version, but it is the same.

![Install Magnet - Borrowed Image](/assets/build/build-370/components/安装磁铁-偷的图.jpg)

#### How to Distinguish Axial Magnets and Radial Magnets

Radial magnets attract stronger horizontally and can rotate freely when attracted sideways.

![Radial Magnet](/assets/build/build-370/components/径向磁铁.jpg)

::: info Suggestion  
At this point, insert filament, power the motor with a 12v~24v power supply to **test if the filament can be pulled**, **if the magnet rotates**, and **to evenly spread the grease**.  
:::

::: tip  
You can insert an optical fiber into the small hole beside the buffer, cut it flush at the bottom for light guidance.  
:::

## Install Circuit Board and Test

### Installation

Place the secondary board onto the middle frame with the photointerrupter facing down, **secure it with two `m2*8` screws**.

Fix the front cover to the middle frame with four `m2*8` screws.

Connect the secondary board to the main board with a flat cable.

The main board connects to the computer via a USB-to-TTL module; only power and ground need to be connected, or you can use the exact wiring used during firmware flashing.

### Testing

> My photos are of the fully assembled finished product with the same effect. It's recommended to test one channel first to avoid unnecessary troubles.

Power on with no action shows the following (main board is not in the photo, indicated by a red LED):

> Secondary board WS2812 is red, buffer light is on, filament online light is off.

![Test - Initial State](/assets/build/build-370/components/测试-原始状态.jpg)

Press the wrench, insert filament, release the wrench, it looks like this:

> Secondary board WS2812 is red, buffer light is on, filament online light is on.

![Test - Insert Filament](/assets/build/build-370/components/测试-插入耗材丝.jpg)

On the basis of the previous step, pull the buffer apart, it looks like this:

> Secondary board WS2812 is red, buffer light off, filament online light on.

![Test - Pull Buffer](/assets/build/build-370/components/测试-拉开缓冲器.jpg)

## Install Feeding Component and Circuit Board onto Base

Very simple, follow the picture below.

![Base Installation](/assets/build/build-370/底座安装.jpg)

Use three `m2*8` self-tapping screws to fix the main board and four of the same screws to fix the main board cover.

Use `m3*14` flat-head screws to fix the feeding component and the base.
